This post will differ from the rest of the blog in the sense that it will illustrate some Data Vizualization techniques, an aspect of my day to day job as a Data Analyst.

In a further post, once I will be satisfied enough with the shape and form of my website, I will outline the various steps I undertook to create this site in its current form (spoiler: lots of tweaks of existing templates that were placed together in here)

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
